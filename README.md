# ism_midterm

## alves_lada_nature_data.csv
Contains the azimuthally averaged radial dust extinction profile expressed in magnitudes of visual extinction as a function of radius (in AU), extracted from Figure 2 of Alves et al. (2001) using an online software called WebPlotDigitizer (Rohtagi 2022).

## ism_midterm.ipynb
Numerically ntegrates the isothermal Lane-Emden equation, estimates the molecular column density and fits the estimated Bonnor-Ebert profile to the extinction data of Alves et al. (2001), given in alves_lada_nature_data.csv.

## midterm_project_wip1.ipynb
Numerically integrates the isothermal Lane-Emden equation and generates plots for different quantities to give the user a better idea of the properties of spheres in isothermal hydrostatic equilibrium and their stability criteria.
